Welcome to my homepage! My name is Jing (Kristen) Zhang. I am now a second-year master's student in the [Department of Communication Studies at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte](https://communication.charlotte.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Min Jiang](https://pages.charlotte.edu/min-jiang/). Prior to embarking on my graduate study, I obtained a B.A. degree in communication studies from [the School of Journalism at Fudan University](http://www.xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/n1339/index.html) in 2021, advised by [Prof. Baohua Zhou](http://www.xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/dm/Show.aspx?info_lb=4&flag=4&info_id=7) and [Prof. Di Cui](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Di-Cui-9). 

My research interests encompass a wide spectrum, including communication technology and society, social media and identity politics, media platform, and crisis management. By now, I have presented at several top conferences in communication studies, including ICA, IAMCR, and NCA. 

Currently, I am collaborating with [Prof. Min Jiang](https://pages.charlotte.edu/min-jiang/), [Prof. Bianca Reisdorf](https://www.biancareisdorf.com/), and [Prof. Erin Basinger](https://www.erinbasinger.com/), on several topics. These include a) The landscape of media ownership and control dynamics in China. This is part of the worldwide research project [*Global Media and Internet Concentration*](https://gmicp.org/); b) The distribution of emotions and opinions across different racial and gender identities regarding crime-related discussions on social media; c) The interplay between news narratives and response strategies in crisis. Besides, I have worked individually or jointly with [Prof. Di Cui](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Di-Cui-9), [Prof. Fang Wu](https://smd.sjtu.edu.cn/english.php/teacher/detail/id/174), and other PhD or master students on several topics including technology information seeking, inequality and collaboration among communication scholars, live streaming engagement, COVID-19 personal narratives, technology use after disasters, and news sharing in algorithmic recommendation environment.

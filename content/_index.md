Welcome to my homepage! My name is Jing (Kristen) Zhang. I am now a second-year master's student in the [Department of Communication Studies at the University of North Carolina, Charlotte](https://communication.charlotte.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Min Jiang](https://pages.charlotte.edu/min-jiang/). Prior to embarking on my graduate study, I obtained a B.A. degree in communication studies from [the School of Journalism at Fudan University](http://www.xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/n1339/index.html) in 2021, advised by [Prof. Baohua Zhou](http://www.xwxy.fudan.edu.cn/dm/Show.aspx?info_lb=4&flag=4&info_id=7). 

My research interests lie at the intersection of technology and society. Specifically, my research topics covered a) technology use and adoption; b) media platform and infrastructure society; c) social media, algorithms, and public opinions. I have an emerging interest in crisis management. For more information about my research, please see [here](https://kristenjz.com/en/research/).

Currently, I am collaborating with [Prof. Min Jiang](https://pages.charlotte.edu/min-jiang/), [Dr. Bianca Reisdorf](https://www.biancareisdorf.com/), and [Dr. Erin Basinger](https://www.erinbasinger.com/), on several topics. These include a) The landscape of media ownership and concentration dynamics in China. This is part of the worldwide research project [*Global Media and Internet Concentration*](https://gmicp.org/); b) The distribution of emotions and opinions across different racial and gender identities regarding crime-related discussions on social media; c) The interplay between news narratives and response strategies in celebrity crisis. 

I'm applying for Ph.D. programs for 2024 fall enrollment.

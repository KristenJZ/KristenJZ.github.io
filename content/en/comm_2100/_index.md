## Short Syllabus for SI

{{<column>}}

Session objectives: Students should be able to 

- further reinforce the theories learned in lectures.
- understand the practical real-life applications of these theories through SI sessions.
- engage in discussions with peers to establish communication-related dialogues.

Session policies: 

- Bring your textbook, supplementary materials, and notes to SI sessions. Reading the session slides before class can generate insightful discussions.
- Show respect, whether it's towards your classmates or your TA. Pay attention and actively participate in discussions when they speak. Most importantly, don't let your phone and social media disrupt you during the session!
- Attendence: Students are required to attend four SI Sessions throughout the semester for a participation grade, worth 5 points each session. Be prepared to show your Student ID Card (physical or mobile). However, students are strongly encouraged to attend SI sessions more frequently to gain maximum comprehension and application benefits.

Other GTA policies:

- If you need assistance with your assignments, please contact me at least 24 hours before the deadline. I won't be able to review your assignments and provide a response within a 24-hour timeframe.
- I am not responsible for grading. If you have any questions regarding assignment, discussion, or exam grading, I'd be happy to help you get in touch with [Dr. Sayde Brais](https://www.linkedin.com/in/saydejbrais/).
- If you require a response to your email, please allow me at least 24 hours to reply. I typically respond promptly. If you haven't received a response after 48 hours, please send a follow-up.

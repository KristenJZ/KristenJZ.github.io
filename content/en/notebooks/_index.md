## Notebooks

### 1. Notes on computational communication

This is a computational communication science notebook based on learning materials from [SICSS](https://sicss.io/curriculum) and [Dr. Wang Chengjun's online course](https://chengjun.github.io/mybook/index.html) on computational communication science.

I applied to the computational social science summer program made by SICSS in April 2022. Though they didn't offer me the opportunity, I was allowed to have access to the materials. Many thanks to their generosity! Meanwhile, I encoutered the GitBook (《计算传播学讲义》) made by Dr.Wang Chengjun in March 2022.

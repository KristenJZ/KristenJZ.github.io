Information seeking is an act when people find there is **an interest or knowledge gap in one area** and  then to acquire new information.It's a concept in information science but has gradually become important in communication studies, especially in scientific communication, health communication and other applied communication studies. 

Here I'm gonna give a list of references on information seeking when I wrote [*my research on the same topic*](https://vimeo.com/722534868/64a926efc3). These references help me a lot while building the concepts and models in the study. Also, I will note each reference to make the contribution clear.

## The origin of the theory

1. **Case, D. O., & Given, L. M. (2007). *Looking for information: A survey of research on information seeking, needs, and behavior.* (Second ed.). London: Elsevier.**

​	My note: In the long time, information seeking is a "taken-for-granted concept"(p.81) and Case decided to give more chances to empirical studies and believed in the process, more and more models will have merits.

## Models on information seeking

Context of the models: actually, health-related contexts are always the background of information seeking studies. There is no wonder that health communication will be the main areas of information seeking studies.

Health related context: Johnson's model, Gorman model, 

Student education context: Kuhlthau's ISP model, 

Other professioinal areas: Leckie's model, 

### 1. models at early stage

1. Kuhlthau's ISP(information search process) model

   **Kuhlthau C.C., (2005) Kuhlthau's information search process. In Fisher K.E., Erdelez, S., & McKechnie L. (eds). *Theories of information behaviors, Information Today.* Inc., Medford, New Jersey, pp.230-234.**

   My note:

   - The first model which takes information seeking as a consecutive process.
   - six stages: initiation, selection, exploration, formulation, collection, & presentation
   - connect feelings, actions, and thoughts at different stages in the search process

2. Leckie model (1996)

   **Leckie, G. J., Pettigrew, K. E., & Sylvain, C. (1996). Modeling the information seeking of professionals: A general model derived from research on engineers, health care professionals, and lawyers. *The Library Quarterly*, *66*(2), 161-193.**

   My note: Leckie et al. (1996) proposed a model considering the characteristics of information source, and believed the characters such as familiarity, trustworthiness, timeliness, cost, quality, and accessibility will influence people's seeking behaviors. Among these, accessbility will be the dominant factor.

   3. Gorman model

   **Gorman, P. N., & Helfand, M. (1995). Information seeking in primary care: how physicians choose which clinical questions to pursue and which to leave unanswered. *Medical Decision Making*, *15*(2), 113-119.**

   My note: This model laid more emphasis on the needs of information seeking, and divided the needs into two categories:  recognized needs and unrecognized needs. Especially in primary care, recognized needs will lead us to seek problem solution. The different influence of recognized needs and unrecognized needs gave rise to a commonly used strategy called "watchful waiting" when immediate action is not deemed necessary. However, this model didn't elaborate on the steps and resources needed in the process. 

### 2. Mature models

1. Johnson's CMIS (comprehensive model of information seeking)

   **Johnson, J. D., & Meischke, H. (1993). A comprehensive model of cancer-related information seeking applied to magazines. *Human Communication Research*, *19*(3), 343-367.**

   My note: This model organized seven factors to predict information seeking and also divide them into three headings:

   - antecedents: demographics, experience, salience, beliefs
   - information carrier factors: characteristics, utilities
   - information seeking actions: actions

2. Ingwersen and Jarvelin model

   **Ingwersen, P., & Järvelin, K. (2006). *The turn: Integration of information seeking and retrieval in context* (Vol. 18). Springer Science & Business Media.**

   My note: The first model considers cognitive actors (authors of information objects, information seekers, designers of database systems, human indexers, selectors deciding on the availability of information objects, communities in a social context...). Also gave more emphasis to the context.

   3. Wilson model

   Wilson starteed to develop the model of information behavior since 1981. 

   **Wilson, T. D. (1981). On user studies and information needs. *Journal of documentation*.**

   In the first version of model, he focused on the "needs"m abd vekueved that it's the needs that caused information seeking behaviors. After information seeking, the individuals will employ information use (demands on informtion systems) and information exchange (with other people) to transfer information. If these parts are satisfied, the satisfaction will lead to the new needs. 

   Also in the model (1981), Wilson identified three categories of basic human "needs":

   - physiological needs: e.g., food and shelter
   - affective or emotional needs: e.g., for achivement
   - cognitive needs: e.g., to learn a new skill

   Wilson also put information seeking in individuals' context: personal, interpersonal and environmental barriers will affect people's information seeking.

   In 1996 and 1997, Wilson developed a more complex and comprehensive model.

   **Wilson, T. D. (1997). Information behaviour: an interdisciplinary perspective. *Information processing & management, 33*(4), 551-572. **

   The information user was shown as "person in context". I summarized three main contributions of the model:

   - identified the possible activating mechanisms behind information seeking: stress/coping theory, risk/reward theory, social learning theory, self-efficacy.
   - identified the information seeking behaviors: passive attention, passive search, active search, ongoing search
   - identified the intervening variables: psychological, demographic, role-related or interpersonal, environmental, source characteristics.

   In 1999, Wilson connected communication factors to information seeking. In the model, communicators work as the information provider. 

   **Wilson, T. D. (1999). Models in information behaviour research. *Journal of documentation*. **

   4. Griffin(1999) RISP(Risk Information seeking process) model

   **Griffin, R. J., Dunwoody, S., & Neuwirth, K. (1999). Proposed model of the relationship of risk information seeking and processing to the development of preventive behaviors. *Environmental Research, 80*(2), 230-245. **

   The model based on TPB theory and heuristic-systematic model, elaborated the relationship between information insufficienty, risk perception, perceived ability and information seeking.

   

   ## Differentiate between some terms

   1. information seeking and information encountering:
